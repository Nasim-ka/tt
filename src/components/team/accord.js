        content:"Sectionals are made of two or more furniture pieces and typically include a couch, corner chair, loveseat or chaise lounge. Because they are available in an array of widths, depths and heights, you can create a custom configuration that works in small apartments or spacious living rooms. For a traditional look, consider making an L-shaped sectional with a couch and a chaise lounge. In a larger area, a U-shaped option made with loveseats and a couch fills the room and accommodates big groups.",
